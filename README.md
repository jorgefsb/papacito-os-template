## 🏗️ Architecture

PapacitoOS is built on four core pillars:

### 1. **Router** (Automatic Detection)
Analyzes every request and automatically detects:
- Which project(s) are involved
- Which agent(s) should be activated
- Whether agents need to collaborate

### 2. **Collaboration Protocol**
Defines how agents work together:
- **Sequential:** Agent A → Agent B → Agent C (pipeline)
- **Parallel:** Agents work simultaneously on different parts
- **Consultative:** One agent asks another for specific input

### 3. **Specialized Agents** (11 Total)

#### Business Agents (80% priority):
- **GM Co-Pilot:** Strategic decisions for business leadership
- **BD Hunter:** Business development and sales
- **PM Brandcade:** Product management for specific products

#### Operations Agents (20% priority):
- **COO Digital:** Operations management
- **Sales Machine:** Outreach and sales automation
- **PM Chatbots:** Chatbot product management

#### Personal Agents:
- **Content Strategist:** Personal brand and content creation
- **Life Coach:** Mental clarity and personal goals
- **Creative Writer:** Creative projects without KPIs

#### Support Agents:
- **Learning Facilitator:** Continuous learning and skill development
- **Research Analyst:** Research and competitive analysis

### 4. **Automations** (5 Core)
- **Daily Briefing:** Automatic daily summary of priorities
- **Project Sync:** Syncs with your logging system
- **Content Pipeline:** Drag document → Get multiple outputs
- **BD Outreach Flow:** Automated business development workflows
- **Metrics Tracker:** Track metrics across all projects
