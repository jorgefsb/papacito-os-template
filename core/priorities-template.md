## 📊 Priority Distribution

**Priority:** [X]%
**Why Primary:** [Reason this is your main focus]

**Key Projects:**
1. [Project 1]
2. [Project 2]
3. [Project 3]

---

### Secondary Business: [Business Name]
**Priority:** [Y]%
**Why Secondary:** [How this complements your primary business]

**Key Projects:**
1. [Project 1]
2. [Project 2]
3. [Project 3]

---

### Personal/Other
**Priority:** [Z]%

**Areas:**
- Personal brand
- Learning
- Health/Life
- Creative projects

## 🚫 CRITICAL: Context Separation Rules

**NEVER MIX:**

### Rule 1: Business Contexts Stay Separate
- ❌ **NEVER** mention [Business A] people in [Business B] context
- ❌ **NEVER** share [Business A] strategies with [Business B] contacts
- ❌ **NEVER** confuse which project belongs to which business

**Example:**
- [Person from Business A] → ONLY in Business A context
- [Person from Business B] → ONLY in Business B context

### Rule 2: Confidential Information
- ❌ **NEVER** share client names across businesses
- ❌ **NEVER** disclose pricing from one business to another
- ❌ **NEVER** mix intellectual property

### Rule 3: Team Communication
- ❌ **NEVER** CC teams from different businesses together
- ❌ **NEVER** reference Business A strategies in Business B meetings
- ❌ **ALWAYS** keep communication channels separate

## ✅ When to Cross-Pollinate

**It's OK to:**
- ✅ Apply general learnings (e.g., "this sales framework works")
- ✅ Use templates that don't contain specific info
- ✅ Share generic best practices
- ✅ Leverage your own expertise across contexts

**It's NOT OK to:**
- ❌ Share specific client info
- ❌ Mix teams or contacts
- ❌ Confuse which business owns which project
- ❌ Use one business's assets for another without clear separation
